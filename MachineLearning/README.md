# MachineLearning
This library features machine learning algorithms for data analysis, statistical modelling, inference and pattern recognition. It provides the necessary abstractions for binding with various ML libraries and currently uses the TensorFlow.NET, TensorFlow.Keras and SciSharp.TensorFlow.Redist NuGet packages.

## Features

- **Feed forward neural networks:** Estimation of a nonlinear relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a neural network.

- **Structural mechanics constitutive modeling using neural networks:** Structural mechanics constitutive law for 3D continuum elements, using a neural network.
